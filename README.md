# Telescopic Tube Clamp

This repository contains parts for building telescopic tube legs. It includes a clamp designed to fit in the middle of two tubes where one is telescoping inside the other, and a foot to protect the floor.

## Motivation

I am interested in building custom furniture that suits my specific needs. One of those needs is for a standing up desk which is easily portable. This clamp mechanism allows me to create height adjustable legs for my standing up desk.

## Parts Required

The clamp is designed to fit steel suitable for table legs. However, the design is parametric so you could adjust it for other purposes.

## Instructions

### Clamp

The clamps are easy to print and require almost no assembly. If you purchased the above bicycle clamps, make sure you remove the internal flanges before fitting.

### Foot

The foot should be printed with 80%+ infill in order to be strong.
